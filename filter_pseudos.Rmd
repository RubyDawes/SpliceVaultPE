# common sense filters
- coverage- annotated intron sample count is > 5th %ile
- alternate exon == 0 - 'pseudoexon' is not in any alternate transcript
- PE_length < 500 - inferred pseudoexon length is < 500
- sample_pverlap > 100- total samples containing the pseudoexon is > 100

```{r}
SpliceVaultPE_filt = SpliceVaultPE%>% filter(sample_count_ann > quantile(SpliceVaultPE$sample_count_ann, probs = c(0.05)) &
                          alternate_exon == 0 & PE_length < 500)  %>%
